    "##Question 1:- Who developed Python Programming Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "##Answer:- Guido van Rossum .\n",
    "\n",
    "##Question 2:-  Whlch type of Programming does Python support?\n",
    "\n",
    "##Answer:- Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Question 3:-  Is Python case sensithve when dealing with identiflers?\n",
    "\n",
    "##Answer:- Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Question 4:- What is the correct extension of the Python file?\n",
    "\n",
    "##Answer:-  . py, . pyi\n",
    "\n",
    "##Question 5:-Is Python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "\n",
    "##Answer:- Python does not need a compiler because it relies on an application (called an interpreter) that compiles and runs the code without storing the machine code being created in a form that you can easily access or distribute. Save this answer\n",
    "\n",
    "##Question 6:-Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language?\n",
    "\n",
    "##Answer:- To indicate a block of code in Python, you must indent each line of the block by the same amount. The two blocks of code in our example if-statement are both indented four spaces, which is a typical amount of indentation for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Question 7:- State a character used to give single-line comments in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "##Answer:- # (hash) is used to make a single line comment. 1. ''' (triple quotes) are used to make multi-line comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Question 8:- Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?\n",
    "\n",
    "##Answer:- Which of the following functions can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on? a) sys.version b) sys.version()\n",
    "\n",
    "##Question 9:-Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called---------\n",
    "\n",
    "##Answer:- Python supports the creation of anonymous functions (i.e. functions that are not bound to a name) at runtime, using a construct called lambda.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Question 10:- What does pip stand for python?\n",
    "\n",
    "##nswer:- pip Install Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "##Question 11:- Mention a few built-in functions in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "##Answer:- The built-in Python functions are pre-defined by the python interpreter. There are 68 built-in python functions. These functions perform a specific task and can be used in any program, depending on the requirement of the user. Some Function are abs()\tReturns the absolute value of a number\n",
    "##all()\tReturns True if all items in an iterable object are true\n",
    "##any()\tReturns True if any item in an iterable object is true\n",
    "##ascii()\tReturns a readable version of an object. Replaces none-ascii characters with escape character\n",
    "##bin()\tReturns the binary version of a number\n",
    "##bool()\tReturns the boolean value of the specified object\n",
    "##bytearray()\tReturns an array of bytes\n",
    "\n",
    "##Question 12:-  What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "##Answer:- An identifier can have a maximum length of 79 characters in Python. Python is one of the most popular programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Question 13:- What are the benetits of using Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "##Answer:- Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "##Question 14:- How is memory managed in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "##Answer:- Python uses a portion of the memory for internal use and non-object memory. Another part of the memory is used for Python object such as int, dict, list, etc. CPython contains the object allocator that allocates memory within the object area. The object allocator gets a call every time the new object needs space.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Question 15:-  How to install Python on Windows and set path variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "33Answer:- In the section entitled User Variables, double-click on the entry that says Path. Another window will pop up showing a list of paths. Click the New button and paste the path to your Python executable there. Once that's inserted, select your newly added path and click the Move Up button until it's at the top\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 16:- Is indentation required in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:- Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.\n"
